The symbolTable is represented as an array of nodes.
Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
When we want to insert a value to the symbolTable we respect the following steps:
    1) we extract the position corresponding to that value using a hash function (getPosition())
    2) we build the node which is going to be inserted
    3) we check if the element from the position obtained is empty, if so , we initialise it with that node 
    4) if not, we parse the list of next nodes until we reach the last element, and we initialise its next reference with that node
            (while parsing, we check if we have that value already inserted, if so , we return -1)
    5) we return the position obtained
